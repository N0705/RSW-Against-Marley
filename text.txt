Tkinter alone cannot prevent users from leaving via Dock, Taskbar, Cmd+Tab, Alt+Tab, or gestures.

To fully lock the screen:

macOS: Use Single App Mode / Guided Access (requires MDM or Configurator).

Windows: Use Assigned Access / Kiosk Mode.

Tkinter can still handle fullscreen, topmost, no-close behavior inside the app itself.
